## UIAutoMonkey
- https://github.com/jonathanpenn/ui-auto-monkey
- written by Jonathan Penn, inspired by Netflix' [Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey)
  - Chaos Monkey is a project from Netflix that randomly kills off systems in a cloud cluster
  - Only does it during business hours so folks are available to respond to and learn from the failures
  - Has helped make Netflix' infrastructure much more resiliant than it otherwise would have been
- double-tap "About" button 
- because of randomness, tests aren't repeatable. Don't necessarily make this part of your unit test suite, but bring it to bear often.
